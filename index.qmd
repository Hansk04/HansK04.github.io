::: {#hero-heading}
I am a **data science major** at **Northwestern University**, originally from **Mauritius**. In 2023 I earned a full scholarship from the Mauritian government as the top‑ranked STEM student nationally. My academic interests span large language models, machine learning, and sports analytics. I aim to harness data‑driven insights to solve real‑world problems and to inspire others through teaching and community engagement.
