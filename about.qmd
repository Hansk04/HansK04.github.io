Hey, I'm Hans
:::

Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a data science major at **Northwestern University**, originally from Mauritius.\
In 2023 I earned a full government scholarship as the top‑ranked STEM student nationally.\
My interests span machine learning, large language models (LLMs), and sports analytics.

## About me

::: grid
::: {#about-me-1 .g-col-6}
**From Mauritius to Northwestern, with a mission to make data meaningful.**

I love applying ML techniques to real‑world data---especially in sports and social good---and I enjoy working in both R and Python. When not coding, you'll find me exploring new analytics papers or writing blog posts on the latest LLM hacks.

At Northwestern I'm deepening my skills in predictive modeling and ethical data storytelling. I'm driven by the belief that data is most powerful when shared transparently and applied responsibly.
